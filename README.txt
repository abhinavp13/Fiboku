Description
===========
Do you love reading great books ?... Sure, we all do. But buying all such books can be expensive, tedious, and a boring task too. Fiboku is on a mission, to help readers find books, not only in their friend’s circle, but also in their friend’s friend’s circle. In this way, Fiboku can find books among large audience, and now, reading books is easy and involve more fun.

Fiboku believe that the book you want to read is already present in your friend circle (or, at least in your friend’s friend circle). It’s already read, and the book-owner would love to lend it to you. Fiboku connects you to our folks so that you can borrow/lend books for free and spread the love of books. Stop searching for cheap books, used books or second-hand books. Borrow/Lend original print books from book readers in your own circle. And yes, don’t cage your books to your bookshelf. Lend your books and bring them back to life.

Come, join Fiboku ! Explore the world of books around you !
